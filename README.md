### Project Title
Data Wrangling Health and Poverty Analysis

### Description
In this project, I utilized Python and its libraries to analyze the correlation between poverty levels and negative health behaviors (binge drinking and smoking) across cities in California. I gathered data from two significant datasets: one focusing on poverty metrics and the other on general health statistics in cities throughout the United States. The goal was to assess the relationship between these variables.

### The project involved the following steps:

* Gathered two datasets using different data extraction methods and combined them.
* Assessed the quality and tidiness of the data, identifying any missing information.
* Cleaned the data to address the identified issues.
* Updated the data store with the cleaned dataset.
* Produced visualizations and answered a research question regarding the correlation between poverty and health behaviors.

### Files Used
Files used in this project include:

PovertyByCity.csv 
ObesityData2017.csv (File name is misleading as this dataset provides a number of health metrics within it. When running the python code, new datasets are spliced and are more accurately named to reflect the data they provide.)

### Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1)
Libraries used in the project:
* pandas (version 2.2.2)
* numpy (version 1.19.5)
* requests
* seaborn
* matplotlib.pyplot
* matplotlib_venn

### Findings
The analysis revealed a weak positive correlation between poverty levels and negative health behaviors in California cities.
